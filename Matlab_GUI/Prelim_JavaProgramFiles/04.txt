4. Solve the below java program    
(Note: Rectangle object is defined as drawRectangle(x-axis, y-axis, width, height))

    class MyCanvas extends JComponent {
        public void paint(Graphics g) {

            g.drawRect (2, 2, 10, 10);
            g.drawRect(5, 5, 10, 10);

        }
    }

Will two rectangles overlap?
