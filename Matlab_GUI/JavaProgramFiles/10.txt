10. Solve the below java program    
(Note: Rectangle object is defined as drawRectangle(x-axis, y-axis, width, height))

    class MyCanvas extends JComponent {
        public void paint(Graphics g) {

            g.drawRect (10, 10, 10, 10);
            g.drawRect(30, 50, 10, 10);
        }
    }


Will two rectangles overlap?
